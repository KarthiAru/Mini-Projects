There is no response either through mail or phone and I need to walk in to the branch for every single requirement and it would take two hours. I have already given the ECS but still I keep getting messages that the ECS is rejected. I got the information that my loan has been disbursed, but the funds got released to me after two months from the date I got that disbursement message.

Further they did not provide any other facilities on top of that therefore I dropped it.,"Aug 27, 2015"
STATE BANK OF INDIA,kolkata,"The response was not that great when it comes to SBI housing loan. As I was getting a better response from HDFC LTD I decided to stay with them.

STATE BANK OF INDIA,pune,"SBI took almost a month's time to respond, otherwise I would say that their response is very poor with respect to home loan. However, when it comes to rates they have offered 0.5% lower than HDFC LTD. Probably because, I had approached them late, as when my process was about to get completed with HDFC LTD , HDFC LTD itself has lowered its rate. Nevertheless, SBI is one of the trusted banks which ONE CAN RELY on.","Aug 26, 2015"
STATE BANK OF INDIA,chennai,"My home loan from SBI Bank has been a very lengthy process. It took almost two months for me to get my loan. They are very less in taking responsibility.

The third party took more than three hours which made me reschedule the appointment only because of the delay. The rate of interest was of 9.4%. The processing charges was high as well, as I had to see to the MOD charges which is normally applicable by the bank. They have also not deducted the EMI yet.
